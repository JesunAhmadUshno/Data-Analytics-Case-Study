# Data-Analytics-Case-Study
Case study for DA510, CS510, BI510: Applying machine learning, predictive analytics, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to solve real-world operational decision problems (e.g., supply chain, quality control).

# Data Analytics Case Study
## Project Overview
This repository contains a case study for DA510, CS510, and BI510, using machine learning, predictive analytics, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to address a real-world operational decision problem (e.g., supply chain management, quality control, or business process optimization).

## Tools Used
- Python (machine learning and predictive analytics)
- SQL (data querying)
- Excel (data analysis)
- Power BI (visualizations)

## Project Structure

- `/models`: Machine learning models and documentation
- `/visualizations`: Power BI reports, charts
- `/sql`: SQL scripts
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis

## Getting Started
